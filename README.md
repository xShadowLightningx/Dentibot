Dentibot: A dental Healthcare for Dental Queries

In the digital era, the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened challenges in accessing healthcare. Intelligent healthcare chatbots, powered by NLP, have emerged as a solution, providing instant, personalized responses and revolutionizing user interaction with healthcare. These chatbots, equipped with API Health reports, enhance accessibility, empower users to make informed decisions, and contribute to improved patient outcomes. Recognizing the crucial role of information technology (IT) in advancing civilization, developers have introduced a healthcare chatbot for dental queries, reshaping the healthcare services landscape.



The Dental Care industry shares challenges with traditional healthcare, such as slow responses, overloaded hotlines, a shortage of specialists, and geographical limitations. Patients often struggle to find timely information, resources, and personalized advice, especially during emergencies. The abundance of online dental information can be overwhelming and lead to incorrect self-diagnosis, increasing the burden on dental professionals. There's a pressing need for a solution to provide concise answers, reliable data, and easy access to oral healthcare resources.
